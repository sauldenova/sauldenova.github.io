I'm a Software Engineer II at Microsoft. I'm currently working on setting up microservices for a Continuous Integration system for the Windows codebase, improving overhead of the system on average from 1-2 hrs to 20 minutes. On the past I've worked with the BuildXL conversion team on transpilers and parsers. I was also a Microsoft intern 3 times. For a more extensive write-up of my projects at Microsoft, [refer here](/work_experience).

I attended [ITESM Campus Estado de MÃ©xico](https://tec.mx/es/estado-de-mexico) and graduated with an honorable mention. I was a TA for the ACM ICPC competitive programming group under the supervision of Professor Ariel Ortiz. I also participated in both the ACM ICPC Mexico and Central America Regional (2012-2015) and the International Olympiad in Informatics 2012. For a sample of my school projects, [refer here](/school_projects).
